I confirm that I have noted the advice of the District/Regional Manager. I
have reviewed the assessed level of bushfire-related risk for the area
concerned, the primary objectives of the burn, the risk register for the burn,
the burn implementation plan and relevant supporting information and have
formed the view - that as prescribed, the risk is as low as reasonably
practicable, and (for other than a scientific, vegetation management or
silviculture burn) the level of bushfire-related risk for the burn area
concerned (or for another area to which this burn relates) is likely to
increase if this burn does not proceed as planned.

Accordingly, I approve the plan for implementation.
{% else %}
I confirm that the persons who have prepared this plan and have provided the
above endorsements are competent and authorised to do so and I confirm that
the plan has been prepared in accordance with the DPaW procedure for planning
Prescribed Burns.

The level of risk associated with the plan is within my authority to approve
and accordingly, I approve the plan for implementation.
